              ><b>Yakuza 6 The Song Of Life</b>:In This Game,Kazuma Kiryu will
              find out exactly how much people are willing to sacrifice for
              family â€“ be those ties through blood or bond â€“ when he
              investigates a series of shadowy events that involve the ones he
              holds closest to his heart. Fresh out of a three-year prison
              sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his
              surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he
              looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in
              Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car
              and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that
              Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand,
              Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to
              unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret
              that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring. From the unparalleled
              realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port
              town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of
              Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is
              the ultimate iteration the gameâ€™s blend of gritty crime story,
              hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those
              locales have to offer.
